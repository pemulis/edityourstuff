          I'd recommend John unconditionally as an editor. He's thorough, patient, and helpful without being intrusive. He found several grammatical errors in my thoroughly self-edited draft, and his insights into what did and didn't work in the story were always right on point.

          John's editing was incredibly beneficial to my work, both developmentally and technically. John took what I thought was a good story and turned it into a great one.

          John helped me edit my novel and offered an in-depth analysis of both the structure of the story and its content. He did so with utmost professionalism and respect to the deadlines that were set. He even offered me his expert view on the direction he thought I should take with the development of the characters, and my novel definitely matured as a result of this. I will definitely be working with him in the future!

          John was exceptionally thorough and well researched. He caught things I wouldn't have found otherwise. He was fast and courteous as well. Highly recommended.

          John was great to work with. His editing skills are the sort of skills that can be useful for any level of writer, whether they're writing a novel or a short story. He has a keen eye for all genres and his advice/corrections are worth every penny in my book. You wonâ€™t find such service anyplace else.
